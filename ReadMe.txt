 - "Triwizard Tournament"
One competition in the TT is to get out of a labyrinth as quickly as possible. Your task as the tournament supervisor is:
given the labyrinth map, initial (current) positions of the three competing wizzards and their relative speeds
(in corridors per minute) predict which of them will reach the exit first. Assume that the magical wands used in the play
are capable of guiding the wizards to the exit along a shortest possible path.


 - "Aunt's Namesday"
Your beloved aunt Petunia is throwing her namesday party, to which as usual, she invites all the family.
There are however some animosities in the family. Aunt's idea is to have two separate tables 
for quest during the party, so that no two disliking one another pair of people will sit at the same table.
Given the list of invited guests and a list of your aunt's suggestions on "who doesn't like whom",
your task, as your aunt's dear little pumpkin sausage computer genius, is to set up a "sitting scheme".
